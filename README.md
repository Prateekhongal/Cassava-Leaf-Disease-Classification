# Cassava-Leaf-Disease-Classification
Cassava Leaf Disease Classification is a project where the machine learning model detects if a Cassava leaf is diseased or healthy.
The machine learning algorithm used here is EfficientNetB3.

# Datasets
It is suggested to use the datasets from Kaggle.

[train/test]_images the image files. The full set of test images will only be available to your notebook when it is submitted for scoring. Expect to see roughly 15,000 images in the test set.

train.csv

image_id the image file name.

label the ID code for the disease.

sample_submission.csv A properly formatted sample submission, given the disclosed test set content.

image_id the image file name.

label the predicted ID code for the disease.

[train/test]_tfrecords the image files in tfrecord format.

label_num_to_disease_map.json The mapping between each disease code and the real disease name.

# Run
Run the "Script.py" for both training and testing.
